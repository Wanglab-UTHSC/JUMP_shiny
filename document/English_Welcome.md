# JUMP Shiny Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to **JUMP Shiny**, a comprehensive web platform designed for protein analysis with a focus on normalization methods and various data pre-processing techniques. This manual will guide you through the user interface, functionalities, and steps involved in performing complete protein analysis using JUMP Shiny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

---
### Accessing JUMP Shiny

Visit the JUMP Shiny web platform to start your protein analysis. Alternatively, if you are dealing with large datasets, you can access the local version on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for a more efficient analysis process.

### User Interface Overview

JUMP Shiny provides a user-friendly interface that enables you to analyze proteomics data and generate insightful graphs without the need for manual command inputs. The following sections describe the key features of the user interface.


## Exploratory Analysis
---

`Exploaratory Analysis` is for uploading data and visualizing original data set.

1.  **Dataset Summarization:** An overview of the dataset, including key statistics and characteristics.
2.  **Sample Distribution Plot:** Visual representation of sample distribution for quality control.
3.  **Heatmap and PCA Graphs:** Displaying significant values in the original data through heatmap and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) graphs.

## Batch Normalization and Covariates Analysis

---
These two sections focuse on batch normalization and covariates correction, providing different plots to visualize the results after normalization.




## Differential Expression Analysis
---

Explore differential expression analysis with detailed tables and interactive plots:

1.  `Volcano Plot`: Visualize fold changes and statistical significance of differentially expressed genes.
2.  `Heatmap`: Interactive heatmap displaying expression patterns of genes.

## Enrichment Analysis

---
Utilize various methods to perform enrichment analysis, showcasing network results for a comprehensive understanding.
