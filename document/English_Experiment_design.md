# Steps for Experiment Design

1. **Navigate to Experiment Design Tab**

    Click on the `Experiment Design` tab located in the left sidebar of this page.

2. **Upload Sample Information**

    At the top left, Click `[Browse]` to upload your sample information table, which should be in `.csv` format.

    Ensure your file follows the correct format shown below. The first column should be the sample ID, with factors to be considered starting from the second column. You can also download the example file by clicking the `[Download example sample information]`.

    The sample information table and the plot showing the distribution of each factor (maximum: 3 plots) will be displayed after successful upload. Note that factors should be categorical variables, and continuous variables should be grouped before uploading.

3. **Experiment Settings**

    Choose your experiment type as either `[Label-free]` or `[TMT-labeling]`.

    Input the number of samples in a batch. For `[TMT-labeling]` experiment, this could be 10, 11, 16, and 18. A WARNING will be shown if the number is greater than 18. For `[Label-free]`, there is no limitaion for the batch size.

    Input the number of IR (Internal Reference) samples used in a batch. This typically would be 0, 1 or 2.

    The `[Optimization level]` is the number of times that the block randamization program will be run to find the best result. You can leave it as the default value.

    Note that when the number of factors is greater than two, achieving an equal distribution for the third and subsequent factors across batches cannot be guaranteed. In such cases, prioritizing factors becomes essential, and the most important factor should be placed as the first two factors to be considered.

4. **Run Experiment Design**

    Click the `[Run Experiment Design]` button. After the program finishes running, it will generate a `[sample assignation table]` and the `[sample number distribution in each batch]` for each factor.  

    The `[sample assignation table]` contains the information provided by the user alongside the batch information generated by the program. For labeling experiments, the table contains an additional column specifying the assigned channel for each sample.

    Click `[Download all results]` to download all results as an .xlsx file.
